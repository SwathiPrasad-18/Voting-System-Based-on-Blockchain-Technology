The secure, blockchain-powered voting process where a voter undergoes ID verification, smart contract issuance, encryption, and decentralized validation before their vote is counted.


#Voter Verification:

The voter scans their ID at an authentication system.

The system verifies their identity and generates a smart contract linked to their vote.


#Casting the Vote:

The voter scans the smart contract at a secure voting machine.

They select their candidate, and the vote is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.


#Blockchain Integration & Security:

The encrypted vote and smart contract are sent to an Ethereum-based blockchain.

Multiple decentralized nodes validate the vote, ensuring no tampering.

The vote is further encrypted using asymmetric encryption and stored securely.


#Final Validation & Tallying:

The encrypted votes are transmitted to an end-server for decryption using private keys.

The results are securely tallied and published transparently.


#Voter Confirmation:

The voter receives a confirmation message, ensuring their vote is securely recorded and immutable.

This system ensures security, transparency, and trust in the electoral process by leveraging blockchain technology and advanced encryption methods.
