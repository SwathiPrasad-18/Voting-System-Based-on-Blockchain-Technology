# Voting-System-Based-on-Blockchain-Technology
The Blockchain-Based Voting System is a secure and transparent digital voting platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. This system ensures fairness, prevents tampering, and allows only registered voters to participate in elections. It utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity to validate voters, manage candidates, and securely store votes.


Key Features
âœ… Secure Voter Registration â€“ Only authorized voters can participate, validated using unique voter IDs.
âœ… Candidate Management â€“ Administrators can add candidates before voting begins.
âœ… Tamper-Proof Voting â€“ Votes are stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain, preventing manipulation.
âœ… Voting Activation & Control â€“ The administrator can start and stop voting as needed.
âœ… Real-Time Vote Counting â€“ Votes are counted automatically, ensuring transparency and accuracy.
âœ… Winner Declaration â€“ The candidate with the most votes is automatically declared the winner.

#Technology Stack
Solidity â€“ Smart contract programming language.
Truffle â€“ Development and testing framework for Ethereum.
Ganache â€“ Local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
MetaMask â€“ Web3 wallet for interacting with smart contracts.
Node.js & npm â€“ Required for package management and contract deployment.
Infura (optional) â€“ For deploying to the Sepolia testnet.

#How It Works
Admin registers voters by assigning a unique voter ID.
Candidates are added to the election.
Voting begins â€“ Each voter casts a vote using their unique voter ID.
Voting ends â€“ Results are stored securely.
Winner is announced automatically based on vote count.

Deployment Options
Local Blockchain â€“ Using Ganache for testing.

Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia) â€“ Deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network for real-world testing.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Integration with a web-based UI using React.js.
ðŸ”¹ Advanced identity verification (e.g., biometrics or government IDs).
ðŸ”¹ Mobile app support for accessibility.
